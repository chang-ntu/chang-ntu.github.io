I received the Ph.D. degree from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) (NTU), Singapore, in 2025. My research focuses on interdisciplinary areas of **AI** and **communication networks**, with a specific emphasis on **mobile edge computing**. Before that, I received a Bachelorâ€™s degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), China, in 2020.
